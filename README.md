==================================

This project was created as a project for a data structures course in the fall of 2013. This project visualizes insertions and collisions of random numbers into a hash table using linear probing to handle collisions.

You can download the JAR file associated with this project [here](http://raw.github.com/bjcrawford/VisualHashTable/master/BC_VisualHashTable.jar) or you can compile the project yourself.

This project makes use of SimpleGUI, a library which provides simplified access to Java graphics and GUI input. SimpleGUI was created by [Rolf Lakaemper](http://www.temple.edu/cis/directory/tenure/lakaemper.html), a professor at Temple University.
